# ECE499-PCB-Design-Assembly-and-Manufacturing-of-a-Power-Distribution-Board

# <h2> Project Description: 
In the avionic system of the aircraft, there is a need for different voltage level, this can be done using
different buck, boost and buck â€“boost converters. The Power Distribution board (PDB) can house all
the circuitry required for the Buck and Boost converters to provide the required output. 

# <h2> Project Requirement:
* Design a 12V to 8V buck converter. (Old design available)
* Design a 12V to 5V buck converter. (Old design available)
* Design a 12V to 3.3V buck converter. (Old design available)
* Design a 12V to 24V boost converter. (Old design available)
* If possible, voltage and current sensing circuitry.
