# ECE499-PCB-Design-Assembly-and-Manufacturing-of-a-Power-Distribution-Board

# <h2> Project Description: 
In the avionic system of the aircraft, there is a need for different voltage level, this can be done using
different buck, boost and buck –boost converters. The Power Distribution board (PDB) can house all
the circuitry required for the Buck and Boost converters to provide the required output. 

# <h2> Project Requirement:
* Design a 12V to 8V buck converter. (Old design available)
* Design a 12V to 5V buck converter. (Old design available)
* Design a 12V to 3.3V buck converter. (Old design available)
* Design a 12V to 24V boost converter. (Old design available)
* If possible, voltage and current sensing circuitry.
